# blue-plate

**blue-plate** is a demonstration of a voice ordering system for a small restaurant that serves coffee drinks and snacks. The demonstration itself is a React application that runs in the browser. It works best in Chrome, but has been tested in Edge and Safari.

The **blue-plate** demonstration is based on the following projects:
* [ShortOrder](https://github.com/MikeHopcroft/shortorder) – an experimental natural language conversational agent intended for domains with a fixed vocabulary of entities and a small number of intents. Uses might include ordering food from a restaurant or organizing your song collection.
* [PrixFixe](https://github.com/MikeHopcroft/prixfixe) – an experimental package of tools and algorithms for constructing restaurant menus and orders and evaluating natural language systems that generate orders. 
* [TokenFlow](https://github.com/MikeHopcroft/tokenflow) – an experimental natural language tokenizer intended for domains with a fixed vocabulary of entities and a small number of intents. Uses might include purchasing items from a catalog, ordering food from a restaurant or organizing your song collection.
