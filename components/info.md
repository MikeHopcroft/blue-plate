This is a demonstration of a
voice ordering system for a small restaurant that serves
coffee drinks and fast food items like burgers, fries, chicken wings, and Mexican.

To place an order, press the green record button and speak as you would to a drive thru worker. Your order will appear below.

You can say things like:
* _Hi! I'd like a grande iced latte with extra foam._
* _Actually, make that a decaf and give me a muffin._
* _Can I get that with strawberry jam?_
* _Remove the strawberry jam._

Click on the `Menu` tab at the top for information about items you can order.
The `History` tab shows a transcription of your conversation. The dropdown in the top right provides an option for downloading the transcription.
