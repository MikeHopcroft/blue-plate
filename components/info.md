To place an order, press the green record button and speak as you would to a drive thru worker. Your order will appear below.

You can say things like:
* _Hi! I'd like a grande iced latte with extra foam._
* _Actually, make that a decaf and add a muffin._
* _Can you make that latte a flat white and get me a cup of coffee?_"

Click on the `Menu` tab at the top for information about items you can order.
The `History` tab shows a transcription of your conversation. The menu in the top right provides and option for downloading the transcription.
